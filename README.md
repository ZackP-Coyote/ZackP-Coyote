# Hi there üëã

## About Me üöÄ

I am Zack Powell, an Applications and Video Game Developer.

My main objective developing apps is to create something that I could use to make my life easier. My idea is to make something that I would find useful and knowing someone out there that will also think the same.

I enjoy participating in Game Jams hosted through *itch.io* to collaborate with other developers and work on a project that tests our skills and our creativity.

Outside of the computer, you can find me playing a round of golf or simply out paddleboarding.

* Featured in Santiago Canyon College's publication of *Echoes of the Canyon* (2020)
* Participated in Github's Game Off 2024
